# v0.2.1 Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2025-12-15

## Summary

This release prefers the ephemeral GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GHCR authentication in CI, reducing reliance on long-lived PAT secrets. It also clarifies CI vs local verification guidance for GHCR access.

## Changes

### CI: Prefer `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GHCR

- Updated CI workflows to log into GHCR using `${{ github.token }}`.
- Keeps `permissions: packages: write` as the canonical control plane for package publishing.

### Docs: GHCR auth troubleshooting

- Clarified that CI should use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, while local verification and troubleshooting can use a packages-only classic PAT.
- Added a fallback SOP for a dedicated GHCR bot + packages-only classic PAT.

## Verification

Pull by explicit variant tag:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/fulmenhq/goneat-tools-runner:v0.2.1
docker pull ghcr.io/fulmenhq/goneat-tools-slim:v0.2.1
```

If CI fails with 403s while pushing to GHCR, treat it as an org/repo Actions/Packages policy issue and record the required setting changes in `docs/sop/maintenance-runbook.md`.
