# v0.1.6 Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2025-12-13

## Summary

This release improves release-process DX (one-command signing + optional release-notes staging), adds minisign to `goneat-tools`, and standardizes in-image license/notice locations for audit-friendly transparency.

## Changes

### Minisign in goneat-tools

- Added `minisign` (apk pinned `0.12-r0`) to the `goneat-tools` image.

### Licenses and notices in images

All toolbox images now include:

- `/licenses/` — third-party license texts
- `/notices/` — third-party NOTICE/attribution files (when upstream provides them)

Curated license texts are included for tools installed from:
- Go module installs (from the Go module cache)
- npm global installs (top-level package LICENSE)
- GitHub release binaries (fetched from upstream at pinned tags)

See `docs/adr/ADR-0003-licenses-and-notices.md` for the decision record.

### Release signing workflow improvements

- New `make release-sign` wraps manual cosign + GPG + minisign signing into one command.
- Added `GPG_HOMEDIR` support for maintainers using multiple GPG keyrings.
- Added `make release-notes` to stage `docs/releases/v0.1.6.md` into `dist/release/` as `release-notes-v0.1.6.md`.
- Manual signing now also publishes an OCI-attached SBOM via `cosign attach sbom` (enables registry-native discovery).

## Verification

### Cosign SBOM (OCI-attached)

```bash
# By digest (recommended)
cosign download sbom ghcr.io/fulmenhq/goneat-tools@sha256:<digest>

# By tag
cosign download sbom ghcr.io/fulmenhq/goneat-tools:v0.1.6
```
